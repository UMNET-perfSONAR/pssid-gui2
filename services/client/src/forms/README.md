Need to verify but I don't think anything in this folder is actually used. 

The idea behind this folder was to create smaller components for each input that we would render on the form (text, multiselect, singleselect, and integer). This would pair nicely with the ./components/cleaned_dynamic.vue

Idea for future implementation^!
